There was nothing special about this exercise.
Didn't optimize the computation for the second part, as the input was not that big.

For the distance comparison, I use a little function with a reduce.
As I need to drag the error to the end, I use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to be sure, that the distance is the highest possible.

----
private boolean distantCheck(List<Integer> list) {
    return list.stream().reduce((n, m) -> (Math.abs(n-m) <= 3 && Math.abs(n-m) > 0)? m : Integer.MAX_VALUE).filter(n -> n == Integer.MAX_VALUE).isEmpty();
  }

To check, if it is always ascending or descending, an equals check to a sorted and sorted-reversed input list is done.

For part 2 I used an `IntStream.range()` to get all possible indices, which have to be removed and used the manipulated list on the same checks as in part 1.
